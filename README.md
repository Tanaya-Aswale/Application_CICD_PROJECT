# ----------Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline------------

# Pipeline Stages

1. Cleanup Workspace:
    * Ensures a fresh environment by cleaning up previous workspace files and artifacts.
2. Checkout from SCM:
    * Retrieves the latest code from the GitHub repository  using the main branch and specified credentials.
3. Update the Deployment Tags:
    * Updates the deployment.yaml file with the new application version or tag. The sed command is used to replace the old tag with the new one.
4. Push the Changed Deployment File to Git:
    * Configures Git with user details, commits the updated deployment.yaml file, and pushes the changes to the GitHub repository.
